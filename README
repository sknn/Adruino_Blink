   Blink
  
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
  
  The circuit:
  * LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground.
  
  * Note: On most Arduino boards, there is already an LED on the board
  connected to pin 13, so you don't need any extra components for this example.
